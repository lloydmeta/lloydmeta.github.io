    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A couple days ago, I released v0.1.3 of <a href="https://github.com/lloydmeta/schwatcher">Schwatcher</a>, which introduces the ability to monitor events on file paths using a composable <a href="https://rx.codeplex.com/">Rx Observable</a> interface. "What does that even mean and why should you care?" is what this blog post tries to answer.</p>

<p>The original version of Schwatcher allowed you to tell a <code>MonitorActor</code> what callback you want to fire when a <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/nio/file/StandardWatchEventKinds.html">certain type of event</a> happened on a file path. This is fine and there are people out there using it in production as is. The limitation to this approach is that (at least by default), the events are difficult to treat as data and thus difficult to compose.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://rx.codeplex.com/">Rx</a>, we turn file path events into an asynchronous stream/channel. Essentially, you tell a <code>RxMonitor</code> object what path and event type you want to monitor and when an event happens, it will get pushed into its <code>observable</code> (the stream). You can then choose to filter, map, or fold over this data stream, creating new data streams. If you wish to cause side-effects, you can add one or more <code>observer</code>s to these data streams.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><em>Note</em>: this blog post applies to v0.1.3 of Schwatcher, which uses v0.18.1 of RxScala. Future versions may introduce breaking changes that invalidate the examples in this blog post.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Suppose we have the following directory structure:</p>

<p><code>
directory1
  - directoryFile1
</code></p>

<p>Let's set up an <code>RxMonitor</code> object to monitor for file creation and modifications events in <code>directory1</code> (note: all operations on <code>RxMonitor</code> objects are thread-safe).</p>

<p>While we're at it, let's grab the base <code>observable</code> from the monitor as well. Note that this <code>Observable</code> will, according to the <code>registerPath</code> and <code>unregisterPath</code> calls made to its parent <code>RxMonitor</code>, push all <code>EventAtPath</code>s to its <code>Observer</code>s. More on what an <code>Observer</code> is later, but for now, think of an <code>Observable</code> as a data stream and an <code>Observer</code> as an object gets pushed new objects from the <code>Observable</code> that it is, well, observing.</p>

<p>```scala
import com.beachape.filemanagement.RxMonitor
import com.beachape.filemanagement.Messages.EventAtPath
import java.nio.file.Paths
import java.nio.file.StandardWatchEventKinds._
import rx.lang.scala.Observer</p>

<p>val monitor = RxMonitor()
val observable = monitor.observable
val directory1 = Paths get "/Users/lloyd/Desktop/directory1"</p>

<p>monitor.registerPath(ENTRY_MODIFY, directory1)
monitor.registerPath(ENTRY_CREATE, directory1)
```</p>

<p>Let's create 2 more <code>Observables</code>. Let's make one called <code>createsOnly</code> that will only care about create events in the directory and another one called <code>scalaSourceCreatesOnly</code> that only cares about create events for files ending in <code>.scala</code>. <strong>Notice</strong> that we're composing here :)</p>

<p><code>scala
val createsOnly = observable.filter(_.event == ENTRY_CREATE)
val scalaSourceCreatesOnly = createsOnly.filter(_.path.toString.endsWith(".scala"))
</code>
Now, let's create some basic <code>Observers</code> that we can pass to the <code>subscribe</code> method of our new <code>Observable</code>s. An <code>Observer</code> at minimum implements an onNext function, which takes an element that will be pushed to it from the <code>Observable</code> that it subscribes to and returns nothing (<code>Unit</code>). It may optionally implement onError (a function which takes a <code>Throwable</code> as an argument and returns nothing) and onCompleted (0 argument function that is called when the <code>Observable</code> it is subscribed to is finished and will no longer send further objects):</p>

<p>Now let's make stuff happen in another terminal.</p>

<p><code>bash
$ ~/Desktop/directory1: touch hello
$ ~/Desktop/directory1: echo lol &gt;&gt; hello
$ ~/Desktop/directory1: touch speedy.scala
$ ~/Desktop/directory1: echo 'println("hmm")' &gt;&gt; speedy.scala
</code></p>

<p>The following will be outputted</p>

<p><code>
Something was created or modified: EventAtPath(ENTRY_CREATE,/Users/lloyd/Desktop/directory1/hello)
Something was created: EventAtPath(ENTRY_CREATE,/Users/lloyd/Desktop/directory1/hello)
Something was created or modified: EventAtPath(ENTRY_MODIFY,/Users/lloyd/Desktop/directory1/hello)
Something was created or modified: EventAtPath(ENTRY_CREATE,/Users/lloyd/Desktop/directory1/speedy.scala)
Something was created: EventAtPath(ENTRY_CREATE,/Users/lloyd/Desktop/directory1/speedy.scala)
A Scala source file was created: EventAtPath(ENTRY_CREATE,/Users/lloyd/Desktop/directory1/speedy.scala)
Something was created or modified: EventAtPath(ENTRY_MODIFY,/Users/lloyd/Desktop/directory1/speedy.scala)
</code></p>

<p>Lastly, since we're done, let's call the <code>stop()</code> method on the <code>RxMonitor</code> object so that subscribed <code>Observers</code> are notified and we stop the underlying <code>MonitorActor</code> as well. Cleaning up is A Good Thing (TM).</p>

<p><code>scala
monitor.stop()
</code></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I hope this post has demonstrated the power of using RxScala's <code>Observable</code> as an abstraction of asynchronous events into a tangible data structure, and how using it through Schwatcher might simplify the process of building your own applications.
